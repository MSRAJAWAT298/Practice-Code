To find all the files in the directory /path/to/directory with a .txt file extension, you can do this:

$files = glob("/path/to/directory/*.txt");

The $files array contains the following from the example directory:

Array
(
    [0] => /path/to/directory/bar.txt
    [1] => /path/to/directory/foo.txt
    [2] => /path/to/directory/link2foo.txt
)

for OPS Framework
echo '<pre>'; print_r(glob(DIR_WS_IMAGES."logs/*.log")); echo '</pre>'; exit;


Example using braces

There are flags which can be passed as a second optional parameter. One of these is GLOB_BRACE which means that e.g. {jpg,gif,png} will be expanded to match jpg, gif and png which can be useful if you need to look for a particular set of files by their extension, in this example for image files.

If the example directory also had the files 1.jpg, 2.gif and 3.png then you can do this to get glob to return just the image files:

$files = glob("/path/to/directory/*.{jpg,gif,png}", GLOB_BRACE);

print_r($files) would echo:
